# LlamaIndex Document Storage POC

This repository is my playground for trying out new ideas for LLM backed applications.  I am looking to understand the programmatic implementations of Large Language Models.  Including the ability to use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in order to build out applications with a specific knowledge set **without** the need to train an actual model for the task.
